# ===========================
# This isn't working. Forgot to account for multiple hashes
# in an array! Stupid mistake. Will need to come back to
# figure this issue out. For now, we will use String keys!


# Before we get to work, we should clear up these hashes
# and convert the keys to symbols to make the CPU happy:
  # The characters variable, at index 0, needs to
  # have the duplicated integer keys removed.

# Now that the unnecessary keys are gone, we need to
# iterate through the array of arrays and make them into
# a hash table. Thankfully, each key can be converted into
# a symbol now.

# ==========================


# The value of the house should be updated for every
# character that is allied with that house, and for every
# stronghold that belongs to that house.
# One difficulty that might come up is re-adding a character
# or stronghold's value to the house over and over.
# Input: thrones database, characters hash, strongholds hash
# No explicit output
# Method will use Ruby to add up the values of chars/castles
# and then SQL to update the values in the houses table.
