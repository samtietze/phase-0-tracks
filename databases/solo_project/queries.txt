Queries:

Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
SELECT * FROM characters;

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
UPDATE characters SET alive="false" WHERE name="Jon Snow";
UPDATE characters SET alive="true" WHERE name="Jon Snow";

Display the information in both tables using one query.
SELECT * FROM characters, house;

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
SELECT characters.name, house.name FROM characters JOIN house ON characters.house_id = house.id WHERE alive="true";

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
DELETE FROM characters WHERE name="Talisa Stark";
SELECT characters.name FROM characters JOIN house ON characters.house_id = house.id WHERE house.name="House Stark";
