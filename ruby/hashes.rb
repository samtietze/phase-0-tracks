# Creating a form using Ruby that allows
# users to store both keys and their values in
# a hash.
  # This could be looped, but the instructions
  # indicate it's unnecessary.
  # User needs to input client name, age, children
  # decor theme, etc.
    # Since no loop, fill out the hash's
    # keys ahead of time; like a proper form.
# The keys should all be entered as symbols.
# Once the form has been completed, all
# of its values should be printed back to the user.

# Prompt the user for any updates once the form
# has been completed. If the user enters "yes" or
# other affirmative:
  # Transfer the user's input to a symbol (assume
  # no mistakes will be made), and then let them
  # enter a new value for that key.
  # Print the final version!
