# Write a class that is capable of allowing
# its various attributes to be accessed from outside
# the class. One user will input a word to the
# class, and another user will input guesses.

# Since the guesses will "fill in" the blanks if
# they're correct, the second user will need access
# to the instance variable that displays the blanks.

# The second user's amount of guesses are related
# to the length of the word. This doesn't mean it
# needs to equal the length.
  # If the user guesses the same letter again,
  # this shouldn't count against the user.

# Each time the user guesses, the game should print
# out its current status. That is, "_______"
# should become "___e___", etc.

# Once the user has guessed the word successfully
# they should be given a congratulatory message.
# If the user loses, they should get a taunting
# message instead.
