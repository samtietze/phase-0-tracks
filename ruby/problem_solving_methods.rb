# Release 1
# Start with a blank array and iterate through
# it to build out the next integers.
# Following the general equation for the Fibonacci
# sequence, we need two variables that will be
# used to create the third number.
  # In order to find the number in the sequence
  # that the user searches for, we have another
  # variable, "n". This will be used later, if the
  # number isn't 0, 1, or 2 (since the sequence
  # begins with 0, 1, 1 in our case).

# Following the first couple of numbers we need
# to use a range that relies on the user's input
# 'n' to find the last number to define in the
# sequence. If n is higher than the first three
# numbers, we simply need to shovel the 0 and 1's
# into the array.
  # Be sure to put the counter outside of the loop!
  # If 'first' and 'second' are inside the loop
  # their values won't increase in each iteration.

# Sorting algorithm: bubble method
# The bubble method iterates through an array of
# integers and compares each set of two in order
# It simply switches the two values based on value
# and relies on a loop that ends once all values
# match the value order.

# Assume an array of eight integers, 1-8. We'll
# use Ruby's RNG method to shuffle them before
# the method starts its work.

# The array works through pairs, which we can
# pull using the each method, and then we'll
# compare the two values using a simple <
# operator.

# The algorithm should be finished once the
# final values are set.
