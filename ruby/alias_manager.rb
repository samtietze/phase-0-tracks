# have to worry about any specifics with the name.

# Once the name is in the fake name generator,
# the first and second positions will be swapped.
# Once this is complete, a different split at the
# character level should occur in order to begin
# altering those characters.

  # to match it with the vowel/consonant index, but

  # the & shorthand, this Symbol#to_proc is
  # nice and easy. It will run a capitalize method
  # on any element in the array that will take it.
  # In this case it'll capitalize the first and
  # last names. However, I don't know how to handle
  # the edge case of an Arabic suffix that remains
  # lower-case ("al-," "ibn," or "bin").
