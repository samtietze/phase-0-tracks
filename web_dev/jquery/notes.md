# How I Did It
I suppose starting from scratch will be first: I gotta do some Googling to see what websites, articles, and other documentation/info is out there about jQuery to begin with.
Finding cheat sheets will be another handy step, but that's not really to bring me up to speed.
I may google up a YouTube video tutorial or two and watch them at a high speed to see what sorts of website elements are being targeted by code, etc.

Breaks may not be super important, but I am doing my laundry, so that'll be nice.
