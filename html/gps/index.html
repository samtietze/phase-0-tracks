<body>
<main>This is the main element. This is perhaps an outline of what you'll find on the rest of this page.
  <article>This is an article element. The article could make up almost everything on the page. For example, a New York Times article is almost entirely contained within this tag.
    <header>Headers can be within article tags too!</header>
    <h1>Gibberish!</h1>
  </article>
</main>

<header><p>This is a header section. It's a container that typically remains at the top of the screen. Could have nav items nested within it. <em>Not</em> the head section.</p></header>


<h2>The h1 section is the biggest level of header text. h2 is next.</h2>
<p>Gibberish for an entire paragraph. Second sentence.</p>
<p>More gibberish in a second paragrpah. Etc.</p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<section>
  <h3>Heading for the section</h3>
  <p>Not quite a p, not quite a div. Nuanced containers of information. Typically relate to a <em>single</em> theme. Can be nested within a div. Can also be found containing the outline of a page.</p>
</section>
<aside>
  <p>Aside tags can be used for related content to that on the page. This content is typically found within an artice. Aside tags could contain advertisements related to the page one is viewing.</p>
</aside>
<footer>Sometimes nav items might be found here. Displayed at the bottom of the page.

<nav>
  This section could display links to other pages on the website. For example, as a menu.
