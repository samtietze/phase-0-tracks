  <h1>Cthulhu Slumbers</h1>
  <blockquote>The nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh…was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults.<br>
  <em>— H. P. Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu" (1928)</em></blockquote>
  <h2>The Mythos</h2>
  <p><em>The Cthulhu Mythos</em> is the phrase used to refer to the collective works of Lovecraft that encapsulate the lore of Lovecraft's world. Authors who came after Lovecraft rely upon ideas created by him, but have written their own scary and unnerving tales (they are not usually as good).</p>
  <p>Cthulhu is the name of one entity, an "<strong>Ancient One</strong>," who remains trapped deep under the ocean. However, the Cthulhu Mythos specifies a number of these Ancient Ones, or Outer Gods.</p>
  <strong>Some examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Abhoth</li>
      <li>Azathoth</li>
      <li>Nodens</li>
      <li>Nyarlathotep</li>
      <li>Shabbith-Ka</li>
      <li>Shub-Niggurath</li>
      <li>Uvhash</li>
      <li>Yog-Sothoth</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The greater Cthulhu Mythos includes reference to Elder Gods, ancient deities, and generally formless horrors. The Ancient Ones also have minions to do their dark bidding. These lesser evils are the things that go bump in the night, as it were. They may drive people mad, or incite unrest, but generally pave the way for the Ancient Ones to reawaken from their deep slumbers to a world ready to be ruined. It is pretty metal stuff.</p>
  <p>As you can imagine, it is pretty difficult to make good movies based on the Cthulhu Mythos. There are not very many. One pretty bad Cthulhu film, <em>Whisperer in the Darkness</em>, was the precursor to the popular <em>Evil Dead</em> series. Director Sam Raimi created it as an example to stir up interest and try to recruit investors.</p>

  <h2>Sometimes Cthulhu Gets Co-Opted</h2>
  <p>Many have taken a shine to the Cthulhu Mythos in recent years. Consequently, this evil entity whose sole purpose is to enslave humanity and generally wreck up the place has been reimagined in more approachable ways. Cute ways.</p>
